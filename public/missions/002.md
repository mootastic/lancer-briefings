# Mission // #002
## Operation: Daybreak

# Objective
- Neutralize the enemyâ€™s comms jamming network, then locate and secure Captain Farris and Ambassador Bannerjee.

# Parameters
- Intel places the nearest transmitter within a nearby financial/commercial district. The area is densely packed with tall buildings, and there are reports that the Vestan Sovereignty has begun to deploy air assets in defense of its strongpoints throughout the city. The existence of the jamming network also indicates that the Sovereignty forces have
significant electronic warfare assets at their disposal; anticipate systemic invasion and localized sensor jamming/optical camouflage-equivalent capabilities.

# Stakes
- Failure to neutralize the enemy jamming network on schedule will cause the LSA advance into Nov Elysia's central district to face heavy resistance likely incurring serious casualties and collateral damage to the LSA troops and the city itself.
Failure to secure Captain Farris and Ambassasador Bannerjee will likely result in them being taken prisoner and summarily executed.

# Reward
- Recommendation for License Level increase and access to prototype gear from the LSA armory.

# Reserves
- Bombardment Available.
