## Dax Morrow was a low-level diplomat with one job: don’t start wars. Then came the Banquet of Nine Moons, a peace summit that ended when Dax confused a ceremonial handshake with a duel challenge and accidentally triggered a centuries-old blood feud. The resulting shootout vaporized three envoys, an entire neutral moon, and Dax’s career.

## Now blacklisted by every diplomatic corps from Union to the Apian Fleet, Dax took the only logical next step: got a mech license.

## Operating under the callsign “Ambassassin,” he insists he’s still doing diplomacy—just louder, faster, and with significantly more missiles. His favorite saying:

    “I am trying to make peace. I just need everyone else to shut up first.”
